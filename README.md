# future-learn-analysis
An analysis into Future Learn Newcastle University security online course concentrating on analysing the types of learns in the platform.

## File Structure (Relevent Directories):

* `data`: Contains datasets before the Data Preparation stage
* `docs`: Contains test documentation as RMarkdown and PDF
* `lib`: `Helpers.R` contains helper functions used in the Data Preparation stage
* `munge`: Contains `1DataPreparation.R` preprocessing script used for Data Preparation
* `reports`: Contains the Data Understanding and Data Preparation stages reports in	RMarkdown and PDF formats
* `tests`: Contains the files used to test data cleaning functions (`1Cleaning.R`) and aggregation + merge functions (`2AggregationMerge.R`)

## Usage

* Update R
	+ In R Studio GUI: Tool -> Check for Package Updates
	+ In R Studio GUI: Help -> Check for Updates
* Change Working Directory to project root
	+ In R Studio GUI: Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory
* Clear environment
	+ In console: `rm(lis = ls())`
* Install and load `ProjectTemplate`
	+ In console: `install.packages(ProjectTemplate)`
	+ In console: `library(ProjectTemplate)`
* Load `ProjectTemplate` Project
	+ In console: `load.project()`
	Data cleaning, aggregation and merging should run alongside the project from the
	  munge script (`1DataPrepartion.R`) when `load.project` is called
* To run Data Preparation (clean, aggregate and merge):
	+ As stated before, call `load.project()`
* To run tests:
	+ `test.project()`
* To run Data Understanding analysis:
	+ Knit the `DataUnderstanding.Rmd`
